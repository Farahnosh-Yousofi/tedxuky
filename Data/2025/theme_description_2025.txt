Theme: Mosaic Minds
Our theme, Mosaic Thinking, celebrates the beauty and power of combining diverse thoughts, experiences, and perspectives to create transformative results. Much like a mosaic, where each unique piece finds its place in a grander design, our ideas and individual stories come together to reveal a more profound, unified picture. Through this lens, we acknowledge that every seemingly unrelated insight, every distinct experience, contributes to a larger narrativeâ€”one that shapes us not only as individuals but as a connected community.
