Hannah Drake
Poet, (Un)Known Project, Co-Founder
Hannah Drake is an author, activist, poet, and public speaker. She co-founded (Un)Known Project, which works to unearth hidden names and stories of Black people enslaved in America and the global African diaspora. She writes commentary on politics, feminism, and race, and her writing has been featured online at Cosmopolitan, The Washington Post, The Bitter Southerner, The Lily, and Harper’s Bazaar. Hannah was selected as a Soros Equality Fellow as an individual who they believe will become a long-term innovative leader impacting racial justice. Recently, Hannah was inducted into the Kentucky Women Remembered exhibit which seeks to honor outstanding women who have made significant contributions to Kentucky’s history. Hannah’s message is thought-provoking and at times challenging, however, she believes that it is in uncomfortable spaces that change can take place. “My sole purpose in writing and speaking is not to entertain you. I am trying to shake a nation.”
