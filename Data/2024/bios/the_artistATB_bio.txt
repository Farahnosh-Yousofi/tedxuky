the artist ATB
Metamodern Artist, Creator of SOULED
With his lifelong, time-based work of art called SOULED, the artist ATB conspires with audiences to foreground context as the origin of meaning and value. SOULED is an evolving project that fuses performance and visual art through time. Itâ€™s created in editions of 12 prints that double in value as they sell, ranging from a few dollars in the beginning to several thousand by the end. But any works unsold after 12 days are immolated in a recorded performance. His talk explains how appropriating context transforms our perception of art and life. Using personal narrative, famous works of art, and SOULED itself, the artist ATB explores the creation of meaning and value within our brief allotment of time.
